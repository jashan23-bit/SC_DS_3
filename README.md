# Task 3 - Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project is part of my internship at **Skillcraft Technology** as a Data Science Intern.

## 🗂️ Dataset Used

The data is from a **Portuguese bank marketing campaign**, and the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`y` column).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `graphviz`

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded and preprocessed the data
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Exported:
  - Predictions to CSV
  - Tree visualization to PNG and PDF

## 🔍 Example Outputs

### Confusion Matrix
This shows how well the model classified the test data:
